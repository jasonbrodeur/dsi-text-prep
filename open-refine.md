# Prep and Analysis with OpenRefine

## Part I

### Introduction

In the first part of today's workshop, we'll use OpenRefine to prepare text and do some initial or even lightweight analysis.

We’ll be using transcripts of a 1970s radio show, Soul of Reason, which is held at NYU’s University Archives. Over the last year, a team at [NYU Libraries](https://library.nyu.edu/) and [NYU's Institute of African American Affairs and Center for Black Visual Culture](https://nyuiaaa.org/) held transcribe-a-thon events to hand-correct autogenerated transcripts and a Wikipedia and Wikidata edit-a-thon. You can find out more about our project on our [website](https://nyu-dss.github.io/soul-of-reason/).

In Fall 2020, the Soul of Reason project team worked with NYU data science graduate student Nyla Ennels, who performed some text analysis on a subset of about 53 corrected transcripts. She wrote a Python script to conduct named entity recognition (NER) on the texts and extract the discovered entities into a spreadsheet that could be analyzed further. You can [read more about Nyla's work and find links to her code and Jupyter Notebooks on our website](https://nyu-dss.github.io/soul-of-reason/updates/creating-a-named-entity-recognition-pipeline/).

In the OpenRefine portion of today’s workshop, we’ll use OpenRefine to get a visual sense of some of the kinds of data transformations that happen during text prep and analysis.

## Embedding a screenshot (in the assets/img/ folder)
1. Easy way with built-in markdown code (if image is already the right size): 
```![screenshot of jay's desktop](assets/img/screenshot-example.png)```  

results in:   

![screenshot of jay's desktop](assets/img/screenshot-example.png)


2. With html (controlling for size)  

```<img src="assets/img/screenshot-example.png" alt="Freeze a row in Google Sheets" width="400" style="border: 1px solid darkgrey">```  

results in:  

<img src="assets/img/screenshot-example.png" alt="Freeze a row in Google Sheets" width="400" style="border: 1px solid darkgrey">
