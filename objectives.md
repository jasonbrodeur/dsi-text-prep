# About this workshop

## Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, you will be able to: 
* List the common methodological approaches used in text preparation and identify when and how to use them based on source materials and analysis objectives.
* Use OpenRefine to define subsets of a dataset for further processing and normalize textual data and/or metadata
* Explain the benefits and challenges of applying a scripted or semi-scripted approach to text preparation and analysis; identify situations where scripting your work will be beneficial.
* Apply prepared computational techniques to perform common text preparation steps and basic analyses.
